    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Auto Log out</h2>
    
    <p>My 'Iskul' project is almost a year old. It was done a long ago; some fixes needed to be done. One of them were: if someone logs in to account, auto log out from previous device; as I disabled multi-device functionality.</p>
    <p>Until now one account can be signed in to more than one device. Which threw errors because of the <i>Keep Me Logged In</i> mechanism.</p>
    <p>User info comes from database. For that error it shows <i>Logged In User Not Found</i>. Means it couldn't fetch the user data, the return value was just <i>empty</i>.</p>
    <p>That's what I used to fix this. I checked the return value. If it was empty, expire the cookie. </p>
    <br>
    <p >The code:</p>
    <pre>
    <code>if(empty($row['name'])){header("Location: logout.php");};</code>
    </pre>
    
    <p>I know I know I could've just iterate through database for cookie value but isn't it hassle free one-liner?</p>
